# Practice with Redux - IT Logger

## Summary

This is a simple IT Logger app that is practice working with Redux and React. It uses React for the UI and json server as a fake rest API to simulate a real server sending responses.

## Start up

- To run both React and JSON Server at the command line type: `npm run dev`. This will start both React and JSON Server due to the Concurrently library.

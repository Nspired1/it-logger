# Practice with Redux - IT Logger

## Summary

This is a simple IT Logger app that is practice working with Redux and React. It uses React for the UI and json server as a fake rest API to simulate a real server sending responses.

## Start up

- To run both React and JSON Server at the command line type: `npm run dev`. This will start both React and JSON Server due to the Concurrently library.

## Technology

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) Front end library
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) App state management
- [React-Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) Library that links React with Redux
- [JSON Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) Fake rest API
